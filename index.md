<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The propensity of LLMs to portray humanlike behaviour fascinates me.  Since the publication of the Willowbrook report, I have continued to explore the capacity of generative agents to mimic human behaviour... exploring their ability to maintain believable and consistent persona's, their capacity to make human-like mistakes, and their (in)ability to get angry!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few people have asked me what a generative agent actually is, how are they implemented and the frameworks I use... </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont use a framework, as I am keen to get a feeling for what the LLM is able to deliver, without an additional layer of abstraction between me and the LLM.  The key to designing a good persona-agent lies in its initial biography and it's memory retention mechanism. I expand on this more [here](agent-architecture.md)</p>

## Research Publications

### Generative Agents:

* [Welcome to Willowbrook](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/welcome-willowbrook), The simulated society built by generative agents, December 2023.  <i>Not to be confused with <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/27/1107377/a-minecraft-town-of-ai-characters-made-friends-invented-jobs-and-spread-religion/">Meadowbrook</a>!</i> :thinking:

### Cyber Security:

* [Generative AI in Cyber Security](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/generative-ai-cybersecurity), Assessing impact on current and future malicious software, June 2024. <br> 
<i class="fa-solid fa-file-pdf"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Formal PDF](docs/cetas_briefing_paper_-_evaluating_malicious_generative_ai_capabilities.pdf) | <i class="fa-solid fa-pen-ruler"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Final (unedited) Draft](raw_malicious_genai.md)


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alongside my own research looking at the human like capacity of generative agents, I also provide technical expertise to the CETaS team.</p>

### CETaS papers:

* [Securing the UK's Research Eco-system](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/), coming soon.
* [Evaluating Malicious Generative AI Capabilities](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/evaluating-malicious-generative-ai-capabilities), Understanding inflection points in risk, July 2024.
* [The Rapid Rise of Generative AI](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/rapid-rise-generative-ai), Assessing risks to safety and security, December 2023.

## Current Projects:

* Psychometric testing for generative agents.  Is it a good idea to use generative agents as replacement humans in social science?
* Willowbrook baseline configuration; as an evaluation mechanism for new LLM models.
* Unhappy Willowbrook :cry: :rage: - Can generative agents act upon their emotions?  [Research Proposal](rp_unhappy_willowbrook.md)
