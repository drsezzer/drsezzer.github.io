        Hi! I'm Sarah, a Principal Researcher at The Alan Turing Institute, working at the intersection of agents and generative AI.  Alongside my own research looking at the human like capacity of generative agents, I also provide technical expertise to the CETaS team.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The propensity of LLMs to portray humanlike behaviour fascinates me.  Since the publication of the Willowbrook report, I have continued to explore the ability of generative agents to mimic us... including their ability to maintain believable persona's, their capacity to make human like mistakes, and their (in)ability to become annoyed!</p>
<p align=center><img src="https://drsezzer.github.io/willowbrook1.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few people have asked me what a generative agent actually is, how are they implemented and the frameworks I use... </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont use a framework, as I am keen to get a feeling for what the LLM is able to deliver, without an additional layer of abstraction between me and the LLM.  The key to designing a good persona-agent lies in its initial biography and it's memory retention mechanism. I expand on this more [here](agent-architecture.md)</p>

* [The Rapid Rise of Generative AI](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/publications/rapid-rise-generative-ai), Assessing risks to safety and security, December 2023.
* [Securing the UK's Research Eco-system](https://cetas.turing.ac.uk/), coming soon.


## Current Projects:

* Psychometric testing for generative agents.  Is it a good idea to use generative agents as replacement humans in social science?
* Willowbrook baseline configuration; as an evaluation mechanism for new LLM models.
